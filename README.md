# Monetary_policy_rules_ZLB
A simple backward-looking model of the monetary policy transmission mechanism is simulated subject to the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates. Several different monetary policy rules can be compared using loss functions in stochastic simulations. A code to simulate impulse responses is also included.
